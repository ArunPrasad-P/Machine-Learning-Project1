# Cyclone Intelligence: Harnessing Machine Learning for Precise Weather Forecasting
Cyclones cause significant loss of life and economic damage, but traditional forecasting methods 
are computationally expensive and often fail to accurately predict cyclone formation, trajectory, 
and intensity due to the complex nonlinear relationships between atmospheric and oceanic 
parameters. There is a need for machine learning approaches to improve the accuracy, speed, and 
reliability of cyclone predictions, enabling better disaster preparedness and response. 
*project focuses on developing a machine learning-based cyclone prediction model using Multiclass SVM and Regression Neural Networks to improve accuracy, speed, and reliability. The model will classify cyclonic events and predict key metrics like rainfall intensity and wind velocity using large-scale meteorological data. This will enhance disaster preparedness and response, demonstrating the potential of AI in cyclone forecasting.
